# AgentMake MCP: Your Gateway to Multi-Agent AI Systems

**agentmake_mcp** is a powerful and flexible platform for developers to easily set up and manage Multi-Agent Collaboration and Orchestration (MCP) servers. Built on top of the robust **[AgentMake AI](https://github.com/eliranwong/agentmake)** framework, this project provides the tools and infrastructure to create sophisticated multi-agent systems that can tackle complex tasks through collaboration and dynamic task allocation.

## What is AgentMake MCP?

While **AgentMake AI** provides the core building blocks for creating individual AI agents and tools, **agentmake_mcp** takes it a step further by enabling you to:

*   **Orchestrate Multiple Agents:** Define and manage how different AI agents, each with their own specialized skills and tools, collaborate to achieve a common goal.
*   **Build Complex Workflows:** Design and implement intricate workflows where agents can delegate tasks, share information, and work in parallel to solve problems more efficiently.
*   **Create Your Own MCP Server:** Easily set up a dedicated server that hosts your multi-agent systems, allowing for seamless integration with your applications and services.

Think of **AgentMake AI** as the factory for creating your AI workers, and **agentmake_mcp** as the central command center where you assemble and manage your teams of AI agents to work together on large-scale projects.

## Key Features

*   **Easy Server Setup:** Quickly deploy a fully functional MCP server with minimal configuration.
*   **Seamless Integration with AgentMake AI:** Leverage the full power of AgentMake AI's 16+ AI backends and 7 agentic components.
*   **Flexible Agent Orchestration:** Define custom collaboration strategies and communication protocols for your agents.
*   **Scalable and Extensible:** Designed to support a growing number of agents and complex workflows.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** A clean and intuitive API for defining and managing your multi-agent systems.
